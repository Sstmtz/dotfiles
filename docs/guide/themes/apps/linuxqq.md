## Install LiteLoaderQQNT

You need to install the `liteloader-qqnt-bin` package from the AUR repository.

```sh
sudo pacman -S liteloader-qqnt-bin
```

## Themes & Plugins

Here, I recommend a few well-maintained themes or plugins.
Of course, it's best to use pre-packaged software, as this allows you to receive the latest updates and reduces manual operations.

- MSpring Theme

```sh
sudo pacman -S liteloader-qqnt-mspring-theme-bin
```

> [!NOTE]
> After installing the theme, you need to import its `manifest.json` into the plugin manager.
